## How to use

### Compilation

To compile the cpp files, run `./build.sh`.

Note: Compilation is **necessary** before attempting execution.

### Execution

To execute all three cpp files (e.g., interrupts_EP, interrupts_RR, and interrupts_EP_RR) on all of the input files, run `./run.sh`.

Alternatively, one can manually run the binaries in `/bin` produced during compilation using the input files in `/input_files`
